A list of problems found at [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/) that could be useful if you're training for an interview, or if you just want to improve yourself as a programmer.

## General
- [ ] Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)

- [ ] Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}

- [ ] Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)

- [ ] Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.

- [ ] Find the common elements of 2 int arrays

- [ ] Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers

- [ ] Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})

- [ ] Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers

- [ ] Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int

- [ ] Implement parseInt

- [ ] Implement squareroot function

- [ ] Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)

- [ ] Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *

- [ ] HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()

- [ ] HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)

##Strings
- [ ] Find the first non-repeated character in a String

- [ ] Reverse a String iteratively and recursively

- [ ] Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams

- [ ] Check if String is a palindrome

- [ ] Check if a String is composed of all unique characters

- [ ] Determine if a String is an int or a double

- [ ] HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String

- [ ] HARD: Print all permutations of a String

- [ ] HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right

##Trees
- [ ] Implement a BST with insert and delete functions

- [ ] Print a tree using BFS and DFS

- [ ] Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST

- [ ] Find the smallest element in a BST

- [ ] Find the 2nd largest number in a BST

- [ ] Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

- [ ] Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree

- [ ] Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0

- [ ] Print a tree by levels

- [ ] Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

- [ ] Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.

- [ ] HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.

- [ ] HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings

##Stacks, Queues, and Heaps

- [ ] Implement a stack with push and pop functions

- [ ] Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions

- [ ] Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time

- [ ] Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)

- [ ] Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap

- [ ] HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks

##Linked Lists

- [ ] Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)

- [ ] Find the Nth element in a linked list

- [ ] Remove the Nth element of a linked list

- [ ] Check if a linked list has cycles

- [ ] Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop.
	- Example: A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop

- [ ] Check whether a link list is a palindrome

- [ ] Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively

##Sorting

- [ ] Implement bubble sort

- [ ] Implement selection sort

- [ ] Implement insertion sort

- [ ] Implement merge sort

- [ ] Implement quick sort
